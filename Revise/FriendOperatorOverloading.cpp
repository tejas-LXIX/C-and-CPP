/*Operator function must be either non-static (member function) or friend function.

Operator Overloading can be done by using three approaches, they are

Overloading unary operator.
Overloading binary operator.
Overloading binary operator using a friend function.
Below are some criteria/rules to define the operator function:

In case of a non-static member function, the binary operator should have only one argument and unary should not have an argument.
In the case of a friend function, the binary operator should have only two argument and unary should have only one argument.
Operators that cannot be overloaded are . .* :: ?:
