/* STL has algorithms and containers. Containers contain data. Algorithms operate on the data stored in Containers.
In OOPS,algos and data are combined into a class,and accessed using objects. STL goes opposite from OOPS. It separates algorithms from the data structures.
This helps in code re-use. One Container can use all algorithms, and all algorithms can work on any Container.
For this relationship to work, "ITERATORS" are used as a middle ground for "Algorithms" to access data from the "Containers". Iterators act as the common middle ground.
Each container provides a common interface defined by Iterators. Iterators can "iterate" each item inside the Container.
Algorithms therefore,work only on the iterators. They dont need to know anything about the containers.
Also Easily extendable. Defining new containers that provide iterator interface means that all existing algos can work on the new container. Vice-versa too. */
